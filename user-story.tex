This lightning talk showcases the usage of Opencast seen from the perspective
of a lecturer at Osnabrück University.

In 2018, I worked at Osnabrück University as a lecturer where I used Opencast
to record a seminar about “Open-Source Software Development” in which we used
Opencast to record all sessions: both mine and the student's sessions. This
allowed them to review their own performances and provided content for other
students to easily reference in successive sessions.

I will shortly present my experiences when using Opencast. What did work out
well? What didn't? What are things you should be aware of? How did the students
react?
